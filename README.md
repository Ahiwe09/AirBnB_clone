#AirBnB Clone - The Console

This is an AirBnB clone project focused on building a command-line interpreter
using Python. The command interpreter facilitates the management of various objects
within the AirBnB project, such as users, states, cities, places, amenities, and reviews.

##DESCRIPTION

The project aims to create a command-line interface that allows users to perform various
operations on AirBnB objects. These operations include creating new objects, retrieving
objects, updating object attributes, deleting objects, and more.

###How to Start

To start the command interpreter, run the console.py file. This will launch the interactive
prompt (hbnb), where you can enter commands to manage AirBnB objects.

###Usage

The command interpreter supports various commands, including:

create: Create a new instance of a specified class.
show: Display the string representation of an instance based on its class name and ID.
destroy: Delete an instance based on its class name and ID.
all: Display string representations of all instances or instances of a specified class.
update: Update an instance's attributes based on its class name and ID.
For detailed usage instructions and examples, refer to the project documentation.
